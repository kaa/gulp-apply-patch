## Reference

### applyPath(patches, options)

Take one or more unified diffs and applies those in order to the piped files, when ever the relative path of the piped file matches the path of the diff.

#### patches
Type: `String` | `Array`

Either a path string or glob string that will be used to load patch files from disk, or an array of raw unified diffs.

#### options
Type: `Object`

##### options.replaceCLRLF
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

Replace `\r\n` with `\n`Â for Windows compatibility.
